1. Live coding should universally be called live teaching demonistration as not all demos involve coding (e.g. spreadsheets, OpenRefine, etc.)

2. There a bit of confusion about teaching demo exercises - on day 1 afternnon and day 2 morning - a bit of repetition and perhaps time can be used better elsewhere? People were confused and started live coding on day 1 afernoon when they should have just taught a concept to their audience, perhaps from their concept map.

3. schedule is gruelling and 15 minutes breaks are not enough

4. Our example schedule with some lessons skipped and Q&A explicitly in the agenda
