# Feedback to The Carpentries
1. Live coding should universally be called live teaching demonistration as not all demos involve coding (e.g. spreadsheets, OpenRefine, etc.)

2. There a bit of confusion about teaching demo exercises - on day 1 afternnon and day 2 morning - a bit of repetition and perhaps time can be used better elsewhere? People were confused and started live coding on day 1 afernoon when they should have just taught a concept to their audience, perhaps from their concept map.

3. Current schedule is gruelling and 15 minutes breaks are not enough, and more material than can be covered.

4. Our example schedule with some lessons skipped (learners' profiles and Bloom's taxonomy) and Q&A explicitly in the agenda.

5. GDPR issues when signing up for teaching demos/community discussions and leaving email addresses around public Etherpads.

6. CoC email not correct or needs checking (confidential@carpentries.org vs coc@carpentries.org)?

7. Feedback for ourselves when doing online instructor training - when people are in the breakout rooms they loose the view of the exercise slide - just make sure that the text of the exercise is replicated in Google doc/Etherpad and if you modify it in any way make sure those modifications are reflected in the shared doc too (e.g. if you ask them not to write feedback in the doc for example and do feedback verbally).

8. When in breakout room, participants loose view of slide with exercise instruction

# Feedback to us from learners

## What went well/what you liked/what tools/techniques are you excited about using?
- the part on cognitive science is really interesting and can be applied to any side of teaching not only carpentries-wise
- Useful to learn about different types of expertise and how to selectively apply different teaching methods
- I appreciated the examples of how to ask multiple choice questions to help diagnose learner’s issues
- I like that you are conscious of “zoom fatigue” and have built in extra breaks to combat that +1
- practical exercises were useful
- Concept maps are exceptionally handy
- Very useful information on memory usage and techniques to work with short term memory +1
-I enjoyed thinking about the mind maps
- Great to delve deep into cognitive sciences/ pedagogy foundations etc 
- I like the scaffolding approach in general and the faded example +2
- I wasn’t aware of how often I use dismissive language like ‘just’ - really good to know about that so I can improve when supporting colleagues, students, learners; +1+1
- I found the faded examples method useful.
- despite not being a face-to-face course, it went well and was mich more interactive than I expected and ran very smoothly +1
- I liked the explanation making explicit the need to avoid overload 
- I wasn’t looking forward to doing this over Zoom, but it’s working out better than I anticipated. I also like how the schedule has been modified to give us a bit more time out. (This is also useful practical experience for helping with our School’s shift to mostly online teaching in September!)
- Learnt a lot. 
- Granular insights into teaching/ learning practices - VERY useful to go through these considerations in such a structured / systematic format     
- Lots of exercises and questions to engage the audience 
- Good distribution of really useful content across the day, the episodes were well planned
- The pace was great, appreciated the breaks and empathy for online call fatigue! Really liked the use of breakout rooms.
- Good pace and instructors were very engaging
- Enjoyed the exercises this afternoon - less scary than the morning ones :-)
- zoom is tricky, but probably now is a good time to figure out how to do online teaching/learning
- Useful coverage of pedagogy without burdening with too much information, very practical aspects to use in teaching.
getting some theory was really useful
- Very engaging and involved, presentation practice and open discussions have been useful to explore areas
detailed aspects of presenting, quite useful feedback
- very clear and practical grounded in experience
- the reading homework suggested re: the live coding exercise helped give an idea of what was good to try and include/do, and re-doing the same live coding exercise was really useful practice
- great that we had a second go with the practice

## What can be improved upon/what was confusing/what needs clarification?

- When everyone is using google drive it gets a little bit confusing and difficult to use
- I find google docs a bit clunky to use
- The link to the 2018 annual report was broken - I had to google it. I submitted a PR for this on GitHub!
- google docs is a bit tricky to use together I find there is a lot of lag
- Bit tricky to make concept models etc quickly on slides (for me anyway), but doing it on paper makes it quite difficult to share - maybe a little more time on some of these exercises, or encourage folks that pen/paper is still ok :)
- The mental model section was difficult to visualise without examples, difficult to picture the level of detail or concepts to include +2
- Providing an example diagram of a mental model before asking participants to create their own would be helpful +1
 Would it be possible to have more shorter breaks? The hour and a half is a long time to stare at a screen
+1 .  Its also a long time to talk - you did well! +1 +1
- In general, need to providing sufficient example/ abstraction before ask for tasks, also some missed concepts regarding learning mechanism - incorp. findings from other sci. fields beyond psychology, e.g. medicine etc.
- I miss the interaction in an actual class room. I guess nothing that can be changed at this stage. +1
- Unsure how to manage lessons where students have a wide range of expertise
- It would be good to know methods / tools for implementing assessment (just ask a class to throw up the hand on the correct answer? a polling tool suited to rapid answer and display? Ether pad and asterixis?)
- I miss the f2f aspect when doing exercises. It’s a bit lonely working on them in isolation. Having people to work with and bounce off makes them more enjoyable.
- I wasn’t a fan of the mind mapping exercises as I’ve never found these ideas very useful, and my brain is mainly mush at present! (Actually, I think my brain is broken!) (Also a concrete example would have helped to get into the first exercise.) +1000000
- Some more practical examples of some of the concepts would be helpful +1
- Assigning a co-host in zoom can help you mute/manage participants :) 
- Perhaps a slightly longer time for the practice exercise (currently, the 90-second practice). +1
- The Zoom time limit countdowns were a bit stressful! (Similarly, 90 seconds is mentally hard to prepare for and present.)
 ^ perhaps a longer countdown? or a timer for the total time in the room, I got caught out!
- Practicing experience (incl. utility) via zoom is truly damaged by the inherent limitations - but it’s nothing to do with instructor training per se as nowadays there are many coercive factors in place we all have to deal with
- Potentially could explain a little more what prep/format/aims the 90 second teaching might take (ie share screens, show lesson content?)
- Zoom format is difficult for teaching without live coding, difficult to have whiteboard style setup +1
- Perhaps a slightly longer practice could be considered, as that would tap into different areas, such as greater involvement of participants.
- maybe a few more ‘online/remote’ live-coding tips would be handy to give people currently, as we’re likely to be doing more of this in future? 
- The difficulties of live coding over zoom, it can sometimes be difficult to provide feedback that is not specific to the limitations of zoom +1


Up

- Good morning session 
- Enjoyed the practice and getting feedback from peers, made me relaxed
- Liked breakout rooms, worked well
- Liked the course content
- Liked the whole ethos of the course, welcoming, easy to practice and set like that from the beginning
- Liked summary in slides highlighted in yellow
- Comprehensive material, granular, well designed
- Enjoyed the pedagogy lessons of the first day
- Breakouts useful for learning in particular for git exercise and building workshop websites
- Really good to have an opportunity to have a do-over and repeat an exercise and have a chance to correct mistakes

Down

- Would like more educational theory
- More breakroom exercises 
- Sometimes difficult to know what to do in breakout rooms, a better explanations needed before splitting people into rooms
- Not sure what to do 100% of the time while in breakout rooms
- Needing  practical examples of mental models/concept maps/etc. ahead of the exercises
- Having time for exercise clearly set in advance
- Zoom has a feature where you can set a time limit when creating the breakout rooms so participants know how long they have left :)
- Record live coding exercise in Zoom - that would have been nice to see, also mix up groups for the second live coding exercise to get a bit more varied feedback from a different set of peers
- Missed the social interactions with people during the breaks, meeting new people and interacting with the ones he already knew
- A little bit more of implementation, how to retrieve answers from people, etc. despite having attended a few Carpentry workshops
